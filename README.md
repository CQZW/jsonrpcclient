JSON-RPC PHP
============

JSON-RPC PHP is a couple of classes written in PHP implementing respectively 
client and server functionalities of the [JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/) protocol.

The goal of the project is the full encapsulation of the JSON-RPC approach inside a PHP application.
Via these classes, it become possible to offer the network the methods of each one's own classes as RPC services and/or enjoy RPC services exacltly as if they were local objects.

The JSON-RPC PHP classes usage is extremely simple and preserve the JSON spirit:

> It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. [[json.org](http://json-rpc.org/)]

Following this logic, the project is conceived to ensure the best code usability.
